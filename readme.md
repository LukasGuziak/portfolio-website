# portfolio-website


Hi everyone!
Now I start designing my portfolio websites. They will be made using html, java script and sass. GULP was used to create it, by means of which it minimizes the css and js code and graphic files. I am starting the project on September 28, 2022.
Work progress will be uploaded to the test server www.lukasdev.pl .
